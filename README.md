## A Genetic Algorithm to the Traveling Salesman Problem in Java

The Travelling Salesman Problem (often called [TSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)) is a classic algorithmic problem in the field of computer science and operations research. The primary purpose is to develop an optimized algorithm to solve it. There are numerous methodology developed over the decades to find the ideal solution in the shortest span of time & space. One of the techniques in solving TSP is to apply [Genetic Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) to it. 

In this academic project, the algorithm is developed (written in Java), to carry out an experimental approach to find an *ideal* solution to a problem when our solution space spans across up to **2.432902e+18 (20!) possible elements**.
